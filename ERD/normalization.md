# Normalization
In normalization, database tables are created and their relationship are established according to some rules to 
protect the data and and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redunduncy and inconstitent dependency.

Dependency is a piece of information that depends on another information. For example A team's place of work
depends on the area assigned. 

There are rules for normalization. Each rule is called __normal form__. Though it is essential to follow the rules, it is not always possible to comply.

Normalization requires additional tables and some clients find it difficult to do. Voilating any of the first three rules is recipe for problems such as inconsistent dependencies.
